Proposal Final Project
Hollywood gets accused of sexism on the daily. Mostly because people claim that Hollywood is dominated by (white) men both onscreen and off. But bland claims don’t paint a trustworthy picture of how the situation really is. In my final project I would like to visualize these claims to show the full picture. Tackling the whole problem with sexism in Hollywood would be way too much so I’ve decided to focus on one particular, very influential company: Disney.
My dataset will not try to prove anything but rather visualize the data which can be used to prove points on sexism in Hollywood. 
The main features of my interactive data will be:
-	A diagram with the balance of male and female dialogue for around 25 Disney films
-	A line graph of this balance over the years to see how this balance has changed/is changing
-	A circle graph which visualizes these 25 Disney films divided by percentage of male dialogue

See doc folder for visualization of these features/graphs


These are the datasets I found online which I’m going to be using:
-	https://github.com/matthewfdaniels/scripts/blob/graphs/character_list5.csv
-	https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1fbcldxxyRvHjDaaY0EeQnQzvSP7Ub8QYVM2bIs-tKH8/edit#gid=1668340193
-	https://github.com/matthewfdaniels/scripts/blob/graphs/meta_data7.csv

I will have to pre-process the data in order to use it for the visualization. One of the csv files has the movie titles with an ID which the other file which includes all characters in the different movies uses. Moreover, the databases include over 2000 movies, most of which aren’t Disney films. I have to make sure to not include the non-Disney movies in my visualization.
As for external components I am not yet sure which ones I want to use. As were only on our third assignment of data processing I’m not yet sure which libraries could come in handy for my project. I am hoping to find this out over the course of the next few weeks.
I would like my project to look like an infographic which is eye-catching but accessible and well-arranged at the same time. The minimum viable product of my visualization would be a website with all the main features as described above and visible in the doc folder. What I would like to accomplish is an esthetically pleasing infographic which is appealing to the eye (see examples in doc). I’m not yet sure if that is something I will be able to accomplish but I’m certainly going to try. I would like to use the Disney house style to show what my visualization is about without requiring the user to even read the text on my page.

This project by a student who did the same project as I am going to do includes two elements I would like to use for my project. The circle diagram in the right bottom corner is an example of the circle diagram I want to use. The graph in the right upper corner is kind of similar to what I want to do for the percentage of male and female dialogue per film, although mine is going to include bars coming from both sides which together make up 100%.
As far as implementation goes, it looks like I am going to have to get more familiar with JavaScript and HTML. The assignments we’re doing right now I find quite tackling as they are, let alone starting this project from scratch. I think that in order for my project to succeed I’m going to have to work in a very structured way by setting daily goals for myself which are doable so I don’t get too overwhelmed by all the work left to do. I am not yet sure about problems I am going to walk into technical wise but I think making sure I stay structured will help keep these problems to a minimal.
